### About

smali/baksmali is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik, Android's Java VM implementation. The syntax is loosely based on Jasmin's/dedexer's syntax, and supports the full functionality of the dex format (annotations, debug info, line info, etc.)

The primary webpage is http://smali.googlecode.com, and the source is also mirrored at https://github.com/jesusfreke/smali. If you are interested in submitting a patch, feel free to send me a pull request on either site.

#### Support
- [googlecode Issue tracker](https://code.google.com/p/smali/issues/list) - For any bugs/issues/feature requests
- [#smali on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=smali) - Free free to drop by and ask a question. Don't expect an instant response, but if you hang around someone will respond. Think of it more in terms of.. multi-player notepad.
